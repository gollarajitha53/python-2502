-> Identifiers

        -> Within Python Identifiers are names given to 

            -> variable
            -> Function
            -> class
            -> object 
            -> method
            -> etc 
        
        -> Identifiers have rules 

            -> Can Contain

                -> Letters (a-z,A-Z)
                -> Digits (0-9)
                -> Underscore(_)

            -> Must Start With

                -> A letter or Underscore
            
            -> NOTE : keywords cannot be identifiers

-> Variables 

    -> Variables are names for Memory (RAM) locations

    -> Variables Allows you to

        -> Assign Data
        -> Retrieve Data
        -> Manipulate Data (If Required)
    
    -> Syntax:

        variable_name = value 
        student_name = "Ravi"
        = is called as assignment operator

    -> NOTE : A function in python is going to do a task

    -> id() : Is used to display the identity of an object 

    -> type() : Is used to display the type of data assigned for a variable

    -> NOTE : In python a variable can change during the execution 

    -> When you want to output string data (combing multiple variables) 

        -> We use Concatenation (Joining Multiple Strings) 

            -> Concatenation operator : + (When used with Strings)
            -> Addition operator : + (When used with Numeric Data)

            -> + (Polymorphism : Multiple Forms)
