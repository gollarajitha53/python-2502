-> Work With Python Code
    
        -> Script Mode (100% We use this from real time) 

            -> Using IDE (VS Code)

        -> CLI Mode (Command Line Interface Mode / Interactive ) (not often used) (Quick Checks)

            -> CLI 
                -> win : command prompt (cmd)
                -> mac : terminal 

                    -> win : python 
                    -> mac : python3 

            -> NOTE : Code written in CLI mode is for temporary purpose
    
    -> Any Programming Language has Syntax (Rules & Guidelines)

    -> Comparing a language like English with Python

        -> English has 26 alphabets (abcd....z)

        -> Python has keywords 

    -> Keyword : Predefined words, which holds special meaning to python Interpreter 

        -> List Of Keywords : https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords

        -> We have 35 keywords 

            False      await      else       import     pass
            None       break      except     in         raise
            True       class      finally    is         return
            and        continue   for        lambda     try
            as         def        from       nonlocal   while
            assert     del        global     not        with
            async      elif       if         or         yield

        -> Keywords + Syntax = Program / Application

        -> NOTE : Keywords cannot be used as identifiers

        -> English 
            -> today i take class for 8 AM to 9 AM (invalid)
            -> today i'll be taking the class from 8 AM to 9 AM (valid)

        -> Python 
            -> print(hello) (invalid)
            -> print("hello") (valid)
